This directory contains a simple example of using Cobertura to
instrument an application and generate coverage reports.

To run the example:
  ant

The application and its tests will be compiled, Cobertura will
instrument the application, the instrumented application will then be
tested, and a Cobertura report produced in HTML and XML.

The Cobertura reports can be found in:
  reports/cobertura-html/index.html
  reports/cobertura-xml/coverage.xml
