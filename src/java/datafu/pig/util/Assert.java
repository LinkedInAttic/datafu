/**
 * Filter function which asserts that a value is true.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, the Pig interpreter doesn't recognize boolean expressions nested as function
 * arguments, so this uses C-style booleans.  That is, the first argument should be
 * an integer.  0 is interpreted as "false", and anything else is considered "true".
 * The function will cause the Pig script to fail if a "false" value is encountered.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is a unary and a binary version. The unary version just takes a boolean, and throws out a generic exception message when the
 * assertion is violated.  The binary version takes a String as a second argument and throws that out when the assertion
 * is violated.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * FILTER members BY ASSERT( (member_id >= 0 ? 1 : 0), 'Doh! Some member ID is negative.' );
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
